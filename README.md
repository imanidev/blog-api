# Blog API

This is a robust and efficient Blog API built using the combination of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

This API is used in the MERN Blog Application deployed on Vercel [here](https://imani-blog.vercel.app/).

---
## Introduction

The Blog API is designed to offer a seamless backend service for blogging platforms. It handles the CRUD operations for blog posts, providing a solid foundation for any blog application.

The frontend of this application uses React.js, React Router, and Vite can be found [here](https://github.com/imanidev/mern-blog).

## Challenges Faced

- **Implementing CRUD Operations:** The biggest challenge I faced was implementing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts. Through reading the MongoDB and Mongoose documentation and persistent practice, I was able to overcome this hurdle.
---
## Unsolved Problems

- The API does not yet have endpoints for user authentication.
  
- There are no endpoints to support search functionality.
---
## Future Enhancements

Here are some future features and enhancements planned for the Blog API:

- **User Authentication:** Implement secure user registration and login endpoints.
  
- **Search Functionality:** Implement endpoints that enable users to search for specific blog posts based on keywords or tags.
  
- **Commenting System:** Introduce endpoints for comments, allowing users to add comments.
  
- **User Profile Management:** Enable users to manage their profile information through specific endpoints.
  
- **Post Categories and Tags:** Introduce categories and tags for blog posts to improve organization and facilitate content discovery.
